        <p className="pb-8">
          Our website uses cookies to identify your computer and recognise you
          from other users to improve your experience.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-8">
          In common with many other website operators, we may use standard
          technology called ‘cookies’ on this site. Cookies are small pieces of
          information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard
          drive. Our cookies enable us to understand who has seen which pages
          and advertisements, to determine how frequently particular pages are
          visited and to determine the most popular areas of our website.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-8">
          Our cookies also enable us to enhance your visitor experience by
          storing information about the products and services that you select
          between visits so that we can provide you with focused information
          each time you visit our website. Most browsers automatically accept
          cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies
          being stored, however if you do turn cookies off this will limit the
          service that we are able to provide to you.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-8">
          Our cookies do not store sensitive information such as your name,
          address or payment details: they simply hold the ‘key’ that, once you
          are signed in, is associated with this information. However, if you
          would prefer to restrict, block or delete cookies from our websites,
          or any other website, you can use your browser to do this. Each
          browser is different, so check the ‘Help’ menu of your particular
          browser (or your mobile phone’s handset manual) to learn how to change
          your cookie preferences.
        </p>
        <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
        <p className="pb-8">
          Some cookies collect information about browsing and purchasing
          behaviour when you access this website via the same computer or
          device. This includes information about pages viewed, products
          purchased and your journey around a website. We do not use cookies to
          collect or record information on your name, address or other contact
          details.
        </p>
        <h3>GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h3>
        <p className="pb-8">
          When someone visits natashalilyrose.com we use the Google Analytics
          service, to collect standard internet log information and details of
          visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the
          number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information
          is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not
          make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the
          identities of those visiting our website.
        </p>
        <h3>MAILING LIST</h3>
        <p className="pb-8">
          As part of the registration process for our monthly e-newsletter, we
          collect personal information. We use that information for a couple of
          reasons: to tell you about stuff you’ve asked us to tell you about; to
          contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to
          check our records are right and to check every now and then that
          you’re happy and satisfied. We don't rent or trade email lists with
          other organisations and businesses.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-8">
          We use a third-party provider, MailChimp to deliver our newsletter. We
          gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry
          standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter.
          For more information, please see MailChimp’s privacy notice. You can
          unsubscribe to general mailings at any time of the day or night by
          clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails or by
          emailing us at contact@natashalilyrose.com.
        </p>
        <h3>FACEBOOK ADS (CONVERSION TRACKING FACEBOOK PIXEL)</h3>
        <p className="pb-8">
          This website uses the Facebook pixel, a small piece of JavaScript
          code, that is added to the website in order to optimise ads, report on
          the success of advertising campaigns across devices and target ads to
          the audience. The Facebook pixel sends information about your browsing
          session through HTTP headers to Facebook, including the IP address,
          information about the web browser, page location, document, referrer
          and web browser user agent. Pixel-specific data includes pixel ID and
          Facebook cookie data to connect the events to a specific Facebook ad
          account and to make a match to a person known by Facebook. Facebook
          checks whether the person has previously seen or interacted with an ad
          from our account or if the person matches an audience rule and
          prepares an analytics report, which contains anonymized or aggregated
          data. Facebook keeps the information collected from the pixels for 180
          days and stores the data collected in its production data centres in
          the US and in Sweden. Facebook supports the DAA’s AdChoices to opt out
          of behavioural advertising and you can check the corresponding
          settings at http://optout.aboutads.info to opt out from the Facebook
          pixel. You can also learn more about why you are seeing an ad through
          Facebook’s AdsPreferences (available here).
